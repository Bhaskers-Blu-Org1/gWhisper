gWhisper - A gRPC command-line client
This command allows to call gRPC RPCs on any gRPC server with reflection enabled.
You may use TAB completion for all arguments (currently only supported in BASH).

SYNOPSIS:
gwhisper [OPTIONS] <hostname>[:port] <service> <method> [<fieldName>=FIELD_VALUE ]...

The default TCP port used to connect to a gRPC server is 50051.

OPTIONS:
  -h
  --help
      Shows this help.
  --noColor
      Disables colors in the output of gRPC replies.
  --customOutput OUTPUT_FORMAT
      Instead of printing the reply message using the default human readable
      format, a custom format as specified in OUTPUT_FORMAT is used.
      See OUTPUT_FORMAT section for a description of the OUTPUT_FORMAT language.
      Note that this is an experimental feature and will be documented in detail,
      once finished.
  --complete
      Shows possible next arguments.
      The output is rendered to be usable as input for bash-completion.
  --dot
      Prints a graphviz digraph, representing the current grammar of the parser.

FIELD_VALUE:
  Field values in the request message may be specified as follows
  - integers:
      decimal (e.g. 46, -46, +46)
      hexadecimal (e.g. 0x45ab, -0x45ab, +0x45ab)
      octal (e.g. 078, -078, +078)
  - floats:
      decimal (e.g. 31, -67.421e-8, 83.456, 23.3e8)
      hexadecimal (e.g. -0xa7b6p-7)
  - bytes:
      As a hex number (e.g. 0xab4b2f5e9d7f)
      NOTE: Only multiple of 8 bits possible
  - strings:
      As a string without quotes. (e.g. ThisIsAString)
      NOTE: currently strings may not contain ' ', ',' or ':'
  - enum values:
      As the enum value name
      Enum values are tab-completed
  - bools
      true, false, 1, 0
      Bool values are tab-completed
  - nested types:
      The nested type fields enclosed in colons. E.g. target=:field1=1 field2=2 :
      Nested types are tab-completed
      NOTE: currently after each field value a space is required
  - repeated fields:
      A list of field values enclosed in colons, separated with a comma and a whitespace.
      E.g. values=:2, 4, 16, 32:
      Repeated fields are tab-completed
  - map fields:
      As a repeated field with nested key, value pairs (protobuf representation of maps).
      E.g. my_map=::key=5 value=testval :, :key=40 value=anotherValue::
      Map fields are tab-completed

OUTPUT_FORMAT:
    This is a program written in a very simple formatting language. A valid program has
    the following form:
        @ (.<FieldName>)+ : ( <String> || /<FieldName>/ ) :
    Example:
        ./gwhisper --customOutput @.listOfDevices:Found device /device_name/$'\n': 127.0.0.1 discoveryService.devices GetDevices

    Output:
        Found device Mouse
        Found device Keyboard
        Found device Screen
        ...
    This will search for any number of fields with a name "listOfDevices" in the RPC reply message. For each match (multiple in case of repeated field), The string `"Found device /device_name/\n"` is printed with `/device_name/` replaced by the value of the field `"device_name"`.


EXAMPLES:
  gwhisper exampledomain.org:50059 bakery orderCookies amount=5
      Connects to the gRPC server running at exampledomain.org on TCP port 50059
      and calls the orderCookies RPC method of the bakery service.
      A request message will be passed to the RPC call with the 'amount' field
      set to 5. Other fields, which might be present, are left at default values.

  gwhisper [2001:db8::2:1]:50059 bakery orderCookies config=:chocolate=true smarties=false : amount=5
      Uses IPv6 address and nested types in the request message.

  gwhisper 192.168.0.43 bakery orderCookies amount=0xa
      Uses IPv4 address, default TCP port of 50051 and field value as hex.
