# Contributing
## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel
free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/ibm/gWhisper/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibm/gWhisper/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us and have a look at the [PROJECT_SCOPE.md](PROJECT_SCOPE.md).

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/gWhisper/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ibm/gWhisper/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from one of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Communication
For feature requests, bug reports or technical discussions, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ibm/gWhisper/issues).

Depending on the need, we might create a channel on matrix.org (see [riot.im](https://about.riot.im/)) or on slack for general questions. In the meantime please contact one of the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) directly for general questions or feedback.

## Testing
As we currently do not have a CI and test framework set up, but plan to do so in the future,
we encourage contributors to ensure that existing unit-tests pass by running `make test` before
submitting a pull request. Also it is highly appreciated if you implement unit-tests
for new code.

## Coding style guidelines
Existing code might not always follow the guidelines listed below. However please
write new code to correspond to these guidelines and feel free to re-factor old
code to be compliant.

### Directory structure
We are trying to stay close to _Canonical Project Structure_ as described [in this proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html).
All new code should follow the directory and naming conventions described here.

### Indentation
This project is indented using spaces. Tabs are not allowed. One level of indentation corresponds to 4 spaces.
```
void myMethod(bool f_condition)
{
    ...
    if(f_condition)
    {
        if(otherCondition)
        {
            doSomething();
        }
    }
}
```

### Naming conventions
- Classes:
    UpperCamelCase
- Methods:
    lowerCamelCase
- Variables:
    lowerCamelCase

    Scope for variables is indicated by prefixes:
```
    g_      -> global scope
    m_      -> object member variable
    f_      -> variable given as method/function argument
    f_out   -> variable given as method/function argument, out parameter.
             I.e. caller expects function to write/modify data referenced
             to by this variable.
```

### Scoping brackets
The curly bracket at scope start and scope end should have the same indentation level and immediately be followed by a new-line:
```
if(condition)
{
    something();
}
```

### Source code documentation
For documenting code, please use the [doxygen style](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) method 3.
For example to document a method:
```
/// Method for doing my stuff.
/// This method is doing my stuff by doing ....
myMethod()
...
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
