# gWhisper
gWhisper is a gRPC command-line client.
It allows to invoke gRPC calls from the command-line.
 
The main design goals are:
- Reflection support (no proto files required)
- Tab-Completion for services, methods __and their arguments__
    (currently only supported in Bash)
- Human readable output in color
- Usable directly in the shell
 
The code for this tool will be released to the public soon under the Apache v2.0 license.
