# gWhisper
gWhisper is a gRPC command line client.
It allows to invoke gRPC Calls from the command-line.
 
The main design goals are:
- Reflection support (no proto files required)
- Tab-Completion For Services, Methods __and their arguments__
    (currently only supported in Bash)
- Human readable output in <font color="green">color</font>
- Usable directly in the shell
- No need to escape characters
 
The code for this tool will be released to the public soon.
